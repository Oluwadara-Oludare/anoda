    description: 'So far we discussed the algebraic manipulation of complex numbers. Consider the geometric representation of complex numbers, which is of great practical importance. We choose two perpendicular coordinate axes, the horizontal x-axis, called the real axis, and the vertical y-axis, called the imaginary axis. On both axes we choose the same unit of length (Fig. 318). This is called a Cartesian coordinate system.',
